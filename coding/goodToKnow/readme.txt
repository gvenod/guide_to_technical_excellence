purpose:

 1. know/refresh existing data structures in cpp
	array, vector, list, set, map, tree, graph
 2. know the basic syntax, logics, loops for faster coding
 3. know when to use what	
 4. know the Big O for each data structure.
    retrieve/insert/delete:
	array/stack/queue O(1) - index based
	list O(n) - go through entire list
	map/set O(1+hash calculation time which is again constant) - uses hash for indexing;
    search:
	array/list O(n) - go through entire list
	stack/queue - not applicable
	map/set O(1+hash calculation time which is again constant) - uses hash for indexing;
